Are you trying to determine if you should be running npm shrinkwrap? Hereâ€™s two handy questions to ask yourself:

1. When I deploy my code remotely, does npm install run?
2. Does my team have at least one individual running npm install more than once a month? (New environment set up, fixing an environment, new dependencies being added, etc.)

If you answered yes to either of the above questions, you should probably be shrinkwrapping your dependencies.
